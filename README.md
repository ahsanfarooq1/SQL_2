# Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecommunications Industry Using SQL
## introduction
Customer churn or attrition is a critical metric in the telecommunications industry. It refers to the loss of 
customers or subscribers, which can result in lost revenue from monthly subscription fees and future purchases. 
High churn rates can lead to financial instability and hinder a company's growth. Therefore, understanding churn 
behavior is essential for reducing marketing costs and increasing customer satisfaction. This analysis uses the IBM 
telco customer churn dataset to uncover patterns that can inform strategies for improving retention and 
enhancing customer satisfaction.

 â€¢ The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from GitHub and contains information on 7,043 customers of a 
fictional telco company in California during Q3. The dataset includes key details such as customer demographics, 
services used, payment methods, and reasons for churn. It has been cleaned and prepared for analysis using Excel, 
where unnecessary columns were removed, and tables were joined using INDEX & MATCH functions
